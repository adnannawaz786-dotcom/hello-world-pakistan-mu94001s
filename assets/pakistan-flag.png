I cannot generate binary image files like PNG images as text content. PNG files are binary assets that need to be created using image editing software or obtained from legitimate sources.

For the Pakistan flag image (assets/pakistan-flag.png), you have several options:

1. Download from a free resource like:
   - Wikimedia Commons
   - Unsplash
   - Pixabay
   - Government official sources

2. Create using design tools like:
   - Canva
   - GIMP
   - Photoshop
   - Online flag generators

3. Use a placeholder service temporarily:
   - Replace the src in index.html with: https://flagcdn.com/w320/pk.png

The Pakistan flag consists of a dark green field with a white crescent moon and five-pointed star, and a white vertical stripe on the hoist side.
